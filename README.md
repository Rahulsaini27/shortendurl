## 5. Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the URL Shortener application on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js**: v14.x or higher (LTS recommended)  
  [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- **npm**: (Comes with Node.js)
- **MongoDB**:
  - Option 1 (Local): Install MongoDB Community Server on your machine.  
    [Install MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/)
  - Option 2 (Cloud - Recommended for ease): Create a free cluster on MongoDB Atlas.  
    [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas)
- **Git**: For cloning the repository.  
  [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

### Backend Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Rahulsaini27/shortendurl
   cd shortendurl
   ```

2. **Navigate to the backend directory and install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   cd server
   npm install
   ```

3. **Create a .env file:**  
   In the `server/` directory, create a file named `.env` and add the following environment variables. Replace placeholders with your actual values.
   ```env
   PORT=5000
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://<your_mongo_username>:<your_mongo_password>@cluster0.abcde.mongodb.net/urlshortener?retryWrites=true&w=majority
   BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000 # This is your backend's base URL
   JWT_SECRET=YOUR_VERY_STRONG_AND_RANDOM_JWT_SECRET_KEY # IMPORTANT: Generate a strong, random string
   ADMIN_USERNAME=admin # Default admin username for initial setup
   ADMIN_PASSWORD=password123 # Default admin password for initial setup
   CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:5173 # Frontend URL for CORS configuration
   ```

   **Important Notes:**
   - **MONGODB_URI**: Get this from your MongoDB Atlas cluster (Network Access must allow your IP, and Database Access must have a user with read/write access).
   - **JWT_SECRET**: This should be a long, complex, and random string. You can generate one using an online tool or programmatically (e.g., `require('crypto').randomBytes(64).toString('hex')` in Node.js console). Never hardcode this in a production environment.
   - **ADMIN_USERNAME and ADMIN_PASSWORD**: These are used for the initial setup of the admin user. For production, you would typically disable the register-admin route after the first user is created or use a more robust admin creation process.

4. **Start the backend server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   You should see output similar to:
   ```
   MongoDB Connected: <your_mongo_host>
   Server running on port 5000
   ```

### Frontend Setup

1. **Navigate to the frontend directory:**  
   Open a new terminal and go back to the root of the project, then enter the client directory:
   ```bash
   cd ../client
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Create a .env file for the frontend:**  
   In the `client/` directory, create a file named `.env` and add the following environment variable:
   ```env
   VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000 # Match your backend's BASE_URL
   ```
   > **Note:** Vite requires environment variables to be prefixed with `VITE_`.

4. **Start the frontend development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   This will typically open the application in your browser at `http://localhost:5173`.

### Initial Admin User Setup (Critical)

For the admin panel to be accessible, you need to create an initial admin user in your database. This is a one-time process.

1. Ensure your backend server is running (`npm run dev` in `server/`).

2. Use a tool like Postman, Insomnia, or curl to send a POST request to register the admin.

   **Request Details:**
   - **Method**: POST
   - **URL**: `http://localhost:5000/api/auth/register-admin`
   - **Headers**: 
     ```
     Content-Type: application/json
     ```
   - **Body** (raw JSON):
     ```json
     {
         "username": "admin",
         "password": "password123"
     }
     ```
     (Use the `ADMIN_USERNAME` and `ADMIN_PASSWORD` you defined in `server/.env`)

   **Example using curl:**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"username": "admin", "password": "password123"}' http://localhost:5000/api/auth/register-admin
   ```

3. You should receive a `201 Created` response. This indicates the admin user has been successfully created in your MongoDB.

> **Security Note:** In a production environment, you would typically disable or remove the `/api/auth/register-admin` endpoint after the initial setup to prevent unauthorized user creation.

### Running the Application

Ensure both your backend and frontend are running in separate terminal windows:

**Terminal 1 (Backend):**
```bash
cd shortendurl/server
npm run dev
```

**Terminal 2 (Frontend):**
```bash
cd shortendurl/client
npm run dev
```

Once both are running, open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173`.

## 7. Architecture Overview

This application adheres to a clear separation of concerns, typical for MERN stack applications.

### Backend (server/)

The backend is built with Node.js and Express.js, providing a RESTful API.

- **Database Integration** (`config/db.js`): Establishes the connection to MongoDB using Mongoose.
- **Models** (`models/`): Defines the Mongoose schemas for `Url` (storing original URL, short code, and visit count) and `User` (for admin authentication). Passwords are hashed using bcryptjs before saving.
- **Controllers** (`controllers/`): Contain the core business logic for handling requests, such as:
  - `urlController.js`: Handles URL shortening, redirection, and fetching all URLs. It uses shortid for generating unique short codes with collision detection.
  - `authController.js`: Manages user registration (for initial admin setup) and login, generating JWTs upon successful authentication.
- **Routes** (`routes/`): Defines the API endpoints and maps them to their respective controller functions.
  - `/api/shorten` (POST): To shorten a URL.
  - `/:shortcode` (GET): To redirect to the original URL.
  - `/api/urls` (GET): To fetch all URLs (protected by authentication).
  - `/api/auth/register-admin` (POST): For initial admin user creation.
  - `/api/auth/login` (POST): For admin login.
- **Middleware** (`middlewares/`):
  - `authMiddleware.js`: Verifies JWTs from incoming requests to protect authenticated routes.
  - `errorHandler.js`: Centralized error handling to provide consistent error responses.
- `app.js`: Configures the Express application, sets up middleware (CORS, JSON parsing), and mounts the API routes.
- `server.js`: The entry point of the server, starts the Express application.

### Frontend (client/)

The frontend is a single-page application built with React, bundled by Vite, and styled with Tailwind CSS.

- **Components** (`components/`): Reusable UI elements (e.g., UrlForm, ShortenedUrlDisplay).
- **Pages** (`pages/`): Top-level components representing different views (e.g., HomePage, AdminPage, LoginPage).
- **Context** (`context/AuthContext.jsx`): Utilizes React Context API to manage the global authentication state (user, token, login, logout) across the application, avoiding prop drilling.
- **Routing**: `react-router-dom` is used for client-side routing, enabling navigation between HomePage, LoginPage, and AdminPage. The AdminPage is conditionally rendered based on the user's authentication status from the AuthContext.
- **API Communication**: Uses the native fetch API to make requests to the Node.js backend.
- **UI Styling**: Tailwind CSS is used to build the responsive and modern user interface by directly applying utility classes in JSX.

### Authentication Flow

1. **Login**: An admin user provides username and password to the LoginPage.
2. **Request to Backend**: The frontend sends these credentials to `POST /api/auth/login`.
3. **Backend Verification**: The backend verifies the credentials against the hashed password in MongoDB.
4. **JWT Generation**: If successful, the backend generates a JWT containing the user's ID and sends it back to the frontend.
5. **Frontend Storage**: The frontend stores the JWT (and user details) in localStorage and the AuthContext.
6. **Protected Route Access**: When the admin navigates to `/admin`, the AuthContext checks for the presence of a valid user. If a token exists, the AdminPage is rendered.
7. **API Authorization**: For requests to protected endpoints (like `GET /api/urls`), the frontend attaches the stored JWT in the Authorization header (`Bearer <token>`).
8. **Backend Protection**: The `authMiddleware.js` on the backend intercepts these requests, verifies the JWT, and only proceeds if the token is valid, otherwise, it returns a 401 Unauthorized error.
9. **Logout**: The logout function in AuthContext clears the localStorage and resets the user state, effectively logging out the user and redirecting them to the login page.

## 8. Code Structure and Best Practices

- **Modularity**: Clear separation of concerns (models, controllers, routes, middleware, context) enhances maintainability and scalability.
- **Environment Variables**: Sensitive information (database URIs, JWT secrets) and configurations are managed via `.env` files, improving security and portability.
- **Input Validation**: Essential for security and robustness, implemented on the backend (`valid-url`).
- **Centralized Error Handling**: A dedicated Express middleware (`errorHandler.js`) ensures consistent and graceful error responses.
- **Asynchronous Operations**: Consistent use of `async/await` for cleaner and more readable asynchronous code in both frontend and backend.
- **Database Indexing**: The `shortCode` field in MongoDB is indexed to significantly speed up lookups, crucial for efficient redirection.
- **CORS Configuration**: Properly configured CORS allows secure communication between the React frontend and Node.js backend.
- **RESTful API Design**: Meaningful endpoint names and HTTP methods follow REST principles.
- **User Feedback**: The frontend provides clear loading states, success messages, and error messages to enhance user experience.
- **Short Code Generation Algorithm**: Utilizes `shortid` for generating compact, globally unique, URL-friendly IDs combined with a database collision check for guaranteed uniqueness and randomness.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Follows a utility-first approach, promoting rapid UI development and ensuring consistency through design tokens.
